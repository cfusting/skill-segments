DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
The code and data in this folder represent the entirety of the necessary resources
to build skill-segments. Software is written in R (for analysis) and SQL (to pull
data). The author develops in a Linux environment both on his home workstation and
the Amazon's EC2 cloud. 

RUNNING SCRIPTS
This is the root directory for all skill-segment scripts. Most scripts will access
files relative to this directory. Depending on how you run the scripts you may
wish to set an environment variable or manually set the working directory in RStudio.

Some R scripts are meant to be run interactivley and will plot results during their
execution. These scripts often depend on a variables "model" which can be obtained from 
one of the many scripts that build an LDA model (VEM or Gibbs) using the "topicmodels"
package.

SQL scripts are designed to be run from inside psql using the '\i' command. Some can
take time to execute and thus 'screen' is recommended such that the user can detach
from the process.

Scripts that build models, especially those that perform cross-validation, can take a 
very long time to run even on a powerful workstation. The author recommends launching
these on Amazon's EC2 cloud. Specifically the VEM cross-validation scripts eat up about
10 GB of memory a piece and thus a memory optimized instance is recommended.
